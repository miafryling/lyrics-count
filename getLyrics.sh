# This script is given a url to search and a file name to output to. This script uses curl to grab the list of songs from 
# the given url, paging through each page to get the first 300 songs. Then from that list, it takes each song url and uses
# curl again to grab the song lyrics from that page and save them to a file called bandname.song_number.txt. These text files
# will be used in myScript.sh and deleted at the end of that script.

# creates a function saveLyrics that takes in a songnumber and a url for the song lyrics
function savelyrics
{
   songnum="$1" # sets the songnum to the first input given to this function
   fullurl="$2" # sets the fullurl to the second input given to this function

   # Curl is used to transfer data. In this case curl is being used to grab the HTML from the given url. The -s flag mutes curl so that it
   # doesn't print it's progress as output.
   # sed is used modify the text in the file. In this case the HTML output frm the curl. In the first use case of sed below -n is used to stop its 
   # usual behavior of echoing everything seen and /start/,/end/p to print just the lines between those two patterns.
   # In the second use case of sed below, sed is used to further modify the output. The format s/old/new/g is used 
   # here to convert every closing angle bracket into a new line.
   # Next,  grep is used to search through the file, returing the text the matches the expression given. the -E is used to signal that the following string to search by is a regular expression.
   # The third usage of sed below  removes the fragmentary remnant HTML code. It uses the same s/old/new/g pattern, including a ; which just allows two sequences on the same line for convenience.
   # Finally, the uniq minimizes the blank lines and the final output is saved to a textfile titled bandname.songnumber.txt
